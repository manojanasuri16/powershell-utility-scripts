youtube-dl:
install yt-dlp using below pip command: [only below version is error free, latest version has bugs]
pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/archive/master.tar.gz

powershell function alias to download best quality youtube videos:
function yt { yt-dlp -f "bestvideo[height<=2160][ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/mp4" $args }

In above function bestvideo height <= 2160p, that is because above 2160p is 8k, which most hardware fails to load

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run the command "notepad $PROFILE. 
   This will open your PowerShell profile file in Notepad.
3. Add the above line to the end of the file and save it.
   Close and reopen PowerShell for the changes to take effect.

Now you can use the yt alias to download YouTube videos with the following command:  
    yt url
        where url is the URL of the video you want to download.
